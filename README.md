A simple feature request web app

This repository will gain at least three sub-projects on the next few days.

The structure is going to be like this:

- one sub-project for a backend API (python + flask + sqlalchemy + sqlite).
- one sub-project for a frontend SPA (ES6 + reactjs).
- one sub-project to automate the deployment of its sibblings.
- the toplevel directory will hold the scripts to setup the dev environment.

These sub-projects *could* be splitted into git submodules, but for the sake of simplicity I will keep everything under a single repo for now.
